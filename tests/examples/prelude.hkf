unsafe module exporting *

-- | Says "fuck you" to the compiler
assume trust_me: Broken

-- | Another way to say "fuck you" to the compiler
def unsafe_coerce(x: Broken): Broken = x

-- | Runs a sequence within an extra layer
assume map_sequence: Layer -> Sequence -> Sequence

-- | Adds a layer to the stack.
-- |   0: Layer gets addded to stack
-- |   1: Layer gets removed from stack
assume with_layer: Layer -> Sequence

-- | Sets the default layer in the stack
assume set_base: Layer -> Sequence

-- | Layer which does nothing
def id_layer: Layer = λ(x: Chord) => x

-- | Make an action require a second press of a button to deactivate (think caps-lock)
assume sticky: Chord -> Sequence

-- | Presses a sequence of keys and releases them once the next key has been released
assume around_next: Sequence -> Sequence

-- | Presses A then B, releases in reverse order
assume around: Sequence -> Sequence -> Sequence

-- | Version of around_next specialized for layers
def layer_next (l: Layer): Sequence = around_next (with_layer l)

-- | The numbers from 0 to 9
template numbers: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
